    "# Inferential Statistics: Comprehensive Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential statistics allows analysts to make generalizations about a population based on sample data. Below are the key concepts you need to know, explained in detail with equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Probability Basics\n",
    "Probability quantifies the likelihood of an event occurring. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "- **Rule of Total Probability**:  \n",
    "  $P(A) = \\sum_{i} P(A \\cap B_i)$\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Conditional Probability**:  \n",
    "  $P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Bayes' Theorem**:  \n",
    "  $P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Distributions:\n",
    "- **Normal Distribution**:  \n",
    "  $f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}$\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Binomial Distribution**:  \n",
    "  $P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Poisson Distribution**:  \n",
    "  $P(X = k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Sampling\n",
    "Sampling is the process of selecting a subset of data from a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "- **Sample Mean**:  \n",
    "  $\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Sample Variance**:  \n",
    "  $s^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2$\n",

    "## 3. Confidence Intervals\n",
    "Confidence intervals represent the range within which a population parameter lies with a certain level of confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equation for a Confidence Interval:\n",
    "- For the mean ($\\mu$):  \n",
    "  $CI = \\bar{x} \\pm z \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Where:\n",
    "  - $\\bar{x}$: Sample mean\n",
    "  - $z$: z-score for the desired confidence level (e.g., 1.96 for 95%)\n",
    "  - $\\sigma$: Population standard deviation\n",
    "  - $n$: Sample size\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "Hypothesis testing helps determine whether a claim about a population parameter is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. Formulate the **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)** and **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$)**.\n",
    "2. Select a significance level ($\\alpha$).\n",
    "3. Compute the test statistic:\n",
    "   $z = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_0}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{n}}$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   For t-tests (when $\\sigma$ is unknown):  \n",
    "   $t = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_0}{s / \\sqrt{n}}$\n",
    "4. Compare the test statistic to critical values or calculate the p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Correlation vs Causation\n",
    "Correlation measures the relationship between two variables, but it doesn't imply causation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pearson Correlation Coefficient:\n",
    "$r = \\frac{\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 \\sum (y_i - \\bar{y})^2}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Central Limit Theorem\n",
    "The CLT states that the sampling distribution of the mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population's distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications:\n",
    "- Sampling distribution mean:  \n",
    "  $\\mu_{\\bar{x}} = \\mu$\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Sampling distribution standard deviation:  \n",

    "Regression predicts the value of a dependent variable based on one or more independent variables.\n",
