    "# **Inferential Statistics**\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential statistics allows us to make inferences or predictions about a population based on a sample. Unlike descriptive statistics, which only summarizes data, inferential statistics uses probability theory and models to make predictions, test hypotheses, and draw conclusions about a larger group from which the sample is drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Population vs. Sample**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definitions:**\n",
    "- **Population**: The entire group of individuals or observations that we are interested in studying.\n",
    "- **Sample**: A subset of the population, selected to represent the population in statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In inferential statistics, it is often impractical to collect data from the entire population, so we use a **sample** to make generalizations about the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Real-Life Example:**\n",
    "A researcher wants to understand the average height of all adult women in a country. Measuring every woman in the country would be impractical, so she takes a sample of 1,000 women and uses that sample to estimate the average height of the entire population.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Estimation**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definitions:**\n",
    "- **Point Estimation**: Provides a single value as an estimate of an unknown population parameter.\n",
    "- **Interval Estimation**: Provides a range of values (interval) that is likely to contain the population parameter, along with a confidence level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Mathematical Formulation:**\n",
    "- **Point Estimation** of the population mean ($\\mu$) is typically the sample mean ($\\bar{x}$):\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Confidence Interval** for the population mean is calculated as:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\mu = \\bar{x} \\pm Z \\cdot \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  where:\n",
    "  - $\\bar{x}$: Sample mean\n",
    "  - $Z$: Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (e.g., 1.96 for 95% confidence)\n",
    "  - $\\sigma$: Population standard deviation (or sample standard deviation if population value is unknown)\n",
    "  - $n$: Sample size\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Real-Life Example:**\n",
    "A poll is conducted to estimate the proportion of people who support a particular political candidate. The sample of 1,000 individuals shows that 60% support the candidate. The estimate (point estimate) is 60%. A 95% confidence interval for the true proportion might be 58% to 62%, suggesting that the actual proportion in the population is likely between 58% and 62% with 95% confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Hypothesis Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definitions:**\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is used to determine if there is enough evidence in a sample to support a specific hypothesis about a population parameter. It involves two competing hypotheses:\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**: The hypothesis that there is no effect or difference.\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$)**: The hypothesis that there is an effect or difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Mathematical Formulation:**\n",
    "- **Test Statistic**: A standardized value used to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis. It depends on the type of test (e.g., z-test, t-test).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  For a **z-test** for population means:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  Z = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_0}{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  where:\n",
    "  - $\\bar{x}$: Sample mean\n",
    "  - $\\mu_0$: Hypothesized population mean\n",
    "  - $\\sigma$: Population standard deviation\n",
    "  - $n$: Sample size\n",
    "\n",
    "- **p-value**: The probability of observing a result as extreme as the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. A low p-value (typically below 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Steps in Hypothesis Testing:**\n",
    "1. State the null and alternative hypotheses.\n",
    "2. Choose a significance level ($\\alpha$), often 0.05.\n",
    "3. Calculate the test statistic.\n",
    "4. Find the p-value and compare it with $\\alpha$.\n",
    "5. Make a decision: Reject $H_0$ if the p-value < $\\alpha$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Real-Life Example:**\n",
    "A company claims that their new diet pill helps people lose more weight than the average of 5 kg in 6 weeks. You sample 100 people who used the pill and find the average weight loss is 6 kg. To test the company's claim, you perform a hypothesis test:\n",
    "- Null Hypothesis: $H_0$: The average weight loss is 5 kg ($\\mu = 5$).\n",
    "- Alternative Hypothesis: $H_1$: The average weight loss is greater than 5 kg ($\\mu > 5$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a z-test, you calculate the p-value and determine if the result is statistically significant (e.g., p-value < 0.05).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. t-test**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definition:**\n",
    "A t-test is used to compare the means of two groups to determine if they are statistically different from each other. It is used when the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Mathematical Formulation:**\n",
    "For a **one-sample t-test**, the test statistic is calculated as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "t = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_0}{\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\bar{x}$: Sample mean\n",
    "- $\\mu_0$: Population mean under the null hypothesis\n",
    "- $s$: Sample standard deviation\n",
    "- $n$: Sample size\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Real-Life Example:**\n",
    "A new drug is tested on a group of patients to see if it reduces blood pressure. The researchers use a sample of 50 patients, and they want to compare the average blood pressure reduction with the known average reduction from a placebo treatment. The t-test is used to determine if the observed difference in means is statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definition:**\n",
    "ANOVA is a statistical test used to compare the means of three or more groups. It helps to determine if at least one of the group means is significantly different from the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Mathematical Formulation:**\n",
    "The **F-statistic** is calculated as the ratio of the variance between the groups to the variance within the groups:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F = \\frac{\\text{Variance Between Groups}}{\\text{Variance Within Groups}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the F-statistic is large, it suggests that at least one group mean is different from the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Real-Life Example:**\n",
    "A researcher wants to test if three different teaching methods produce different test scores among students. Using ANOVA, the researcher compares the means of test scores across the three teaching methods to see if any of them result in significantly different average scores.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. Regression Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definition:**\n",
    "Regression analysis is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable ($Y$) and one or more independent variables ($X_1, X_2, \\dots$). It is used for prediction and forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Mathematical Formulation:**\n",
    "For **simple linear regression** (one independent variable):\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\epsilon\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $Y$: Dependent variable\n",
    "- $X$: Independent variable\n",
    "- $\\beta_0$: Intercept (constant)\n",
    "- $\\beta_1$: Slope (coefficient of $X$)\n",
    "- $\\epsilon$: Error term\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Real-Life Example:**\n",
    "A real estate agent uses regression analysis to predict house prices ($Y$) based on square footage ($X$). By fitting a linear regression model, the agent can estimate the price of a house given its size.\n",
